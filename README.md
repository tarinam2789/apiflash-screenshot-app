# Web Development Project 4 - *ðŸ“¸ ApiFlash Screenshot App*

Submitted by: **Tarina Muna**

This web app: **is a simple React app that lets users capture high-quality website screenshots using the ApiFlash API. Users can enter a website URL and customize parameters like width and height. The app displays the screenshot immediately and keeps a history of all previously captured images.**

Time spent: **1.5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed: 
- [x] Allow the user to add at least three parameters to a query to the ApiFlash API
- [x] Display the screenshot returned by the ApiFlash call on the page
- [x] On a separate part of the page, display all the images the user has queried thus far

## Notes

Loading screenshots correctly was tricky due to caching and invalid URLs. Adding a timestamp to the image URL and validating user input helped fix display issues. Debugging also involved testing API links directly in the browser.
